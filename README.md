This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where the state of a functional component doesn't update correctly after using the useState hook.  The bug.js file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from an improper understanding of how the useState hook manages updates, often leading to unexpected behavior in the UI.
